# Modelling Wine Quality output based on physicochemical test using Python Machine Learning Libraries
Project made for Faculty's Artificial Intelligence class.


## The task
Plotting data analytics observations and training the [Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) on various Classificators.
Inspired by [QUSAY AL-BTOUSH Notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/qusaybtoush1990/wine-quality#Vote%F0%9F%98%8A%F0%9F%98%8A%F0%9F%98%8A%F0%9F%98%8A%F0%9F%98%8A%F0%9F%98%8A).

## Data analytics 
In this section we will demonstrate the plots that describe observed corelations between features and target (wine quality score)

### Features with lesser impact on wine quality

### Impact of alcohol on wine quality

### Impact of total sulphur dioxide on wine quality

## Training the dataset with various classification models
The Accuracy Classification Scores (ACS) obtained are:
- Kneighbours – 51.2% 
- Logistic Regression – 88.6% 
- SVC – 93.4% 
- MLP – 99.5% 
- Decision Tree Classifier – 100%

It is important to note that ACS's could be improved through hyperparameter tuning in order to obtain better scores
